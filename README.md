# void-runit-services
I didn't choose use `&` or `coproc` to start services in ,xinitrc or some else autostart script,  
it's very ugly, an ugly hack. I want my WM startup stuff to be easy, just setup for some one-time stuff.  
runit is awesome, oh god I love it! I just to use it to make my void-linux enven better.
